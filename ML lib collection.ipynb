SciPy contains modules for optimization, linear algebra, integration, interpolation, special functions, FFT, signal and image processing\n","\n","**matplotlib**-- plotting library for the Python programming language and its numerical mathematics extension NumPy. It provides an object-oriented API for embedding plots into applications using general-purpose GUI toolkits like Tkinter, wxPython, Qt, or GTK+.\n","\n","**pandas**-- for data manipulation and analysis. In particular, it offers data structures and operations for manipulating numerical tables and time series\n","\n","**torch**-- used for applications such as computer vision and natural language processing\n","\n","**seaborn**-- Seaborn is a library for making statistical infographics in Python. It is built on top of matplotlib and also supports numpy and pandas data structures. It also supports statistical units from SciPy\n","\n","**wordcloud** --  cloud filled with lots of words in different sizes, which represent the frequency or the importance of each word. This is called Tag Cloud or WordCloud\n","\n","**bs4** -- Basic purpose of building beautifulsoup is to parse HTML or XML documents.\n","\n","**requests** -- The requests module allows you to send HTTP requests using Python. The HTTP request returns a Response Object with all the response data\n","\n","**theano** -- Theano is a Python library that allows you to define, optimize, and efficiently evaluate mathematical expressions involving multi-dimensional arrays. It is built on top of NumPy. Theano features: tight integration with NumPy: a similar interface to NumPyâ€™s. numpy.ndarrays are also used internally in Theano-compiled functions.\n","\n","**networkx** -- for studying graphs and networks\n","\n","**cv2** --designed to solve computer vision problems. It works and process the images.\n","\n","**gym** --  provides an easy-to-use suite of reinforcement learning tasks. We provide the environment; you provide the algorithm. You can write your agent using your existing numerical computation library, such as TensorFlow or Theano."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"dxe8ndslnw4j","colab_type":"code","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":306},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1598057315833,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":6452,"user":{"displayName":"Selvakumar G","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GjeCiQ-qas9fOo5vJHIncfNzWXLPxzGl_aBbt5M=s64","userId":"13956294939872809084"}},"outputId":"d1ed2009-8e4a-4d9c-b3be-8653c4916eb0"},"source":["import sklearn\n","print(sklearn.__version__)\n","import numpy\n","print(numpy.__version__)\n","import scipy\n","print(scipy.__version__)\n","import matplotlib\n","print(matplotlib.__version__)\n","import pandas\n","print(pandas.__version__)\n","import torch\n","print(torch.__version__)\n","import seaborn\n","print(seaborn.__version__)\n","import wordcloud\n","print(wordcloud.__version__)\n","import bs4\n","print(bs4.__version__)\n","import requests\n","print(requests.__version__)\n","import theano\n","print(theano.__version__)\n","import networkx\n","print(networkx.__version__)\n","import cv2\n","print(cv2.__version__)\n","import gym\n","print(gym.__version__)"],"execution_count":1,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["0.22.2.post1\n","1.18.5\n","1.4.1\n","3.2.2\n","1.0.5\n","1.6.0+cu101\n","0.10.1\n","1.5.0\n","4.6.3\n"],"name":"stdout"},{"output_type":"stream","text":["/usr/local/lib/python3.6/dist-packages/statsmodels/tools/_testing.py:19: FutureWarning: pandas.util.testing is deprecated.
